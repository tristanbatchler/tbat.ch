One night, I invited a few friends over to my place for some drinks and snacks and I also wanted to test out my new speakers.

The idea was to create a web app where you can search the name of any song (as long as it's on YouTube) and it will play over my new speakers. I also wanted the ability for anyone to open the page on their phone and queue or skip a song, change the volume, etc.
